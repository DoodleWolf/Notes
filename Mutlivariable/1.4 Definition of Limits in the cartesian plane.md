# Limits
## Definition
$$\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)}{f(x,y)}=L$$
1. every neighborhood of the point $(a,b)$ contains another point that will work in $f$ different from $(a,b)$
2. $\forall \epsilon > 0, \ \exists \delta >0$ such that,
$$0 < \sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^2}< \delta  \text{ then } |f(x,y)-L|< \epsilon$$

## Intuition
It must be able to reach the limit from any possible direction

## Examples
$$ \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} {(x^2+y^2+7)}=7$$
1. $0< \sqrt{x^2+y^2} < \delta$
2. ![[Pasted image 20210202184626.png]]
3. set $\delta = \sqrt{\epsilon}$

(interesting method that takes advantage of polar coords)
$$\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} {\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}}=0 $$
1. $0< \sqrt{x^2+y^2} < \delta$
2. ![[Pasted image 20210202184942.png]]
3. $x=r \cos{\theta}, \ y=r \sin{\theta}$
4. ![[Pasted image 20210202185041.png]]
5. $\delta = \epsilon$ will work

# Lemma 1.4.1

^ca5a89

Given:
$$\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}{f(x,y)}=L \text{ and } \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)}{g(x,y)}=M $$
Then
- addition between limits works
- multiplication works
- division works as long as one does not equal zero
- given a continuous (at the range of $f$) function $h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ then $\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}{h(f(x,y))}=h(L)$

## proof
none is given but I'm also to lazy to write them out, just see analysis book that does them

## Example 
#### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20210202185837.png]]
1. we know the value but we must check if it stands for all possible paths
2. ![[Pasted image 20210202185904.png]]
3. ![[Pasted image 20210202185911.png]]
4. the limits of these two paths are not the same hence the limit does not exist

a different approach:
![[Pasted image 20210202190359.png]]
- notice that the limit varies for different $y$ so it cannot exist

but this should not be over-relied on:
#### Example 2: $f(x,y)= \frac{2x^2 y}{x^4+y^2}$
investigate $(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)$

Using line method:
![[Pasted image 20210202190815.png]]
- which would  suggest 0 for the limit

Considering a parabola:
![[Pasted image 20210202190913.png]]
- which would suggest 1

hence the the limit does not exist

### Remark
These problems in test will have a hint

# Continuity
## Defintion
*continuous* at $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ if $\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)}{f(x,y)}=f(a,b)$
*continuous* at every point of a subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
the statements follow from [[#^ca5a89 | Lemma 1.4.1]] but gotta be careful around
