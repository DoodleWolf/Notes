## Weakness
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures **CVE**
(descripition with a few references)
- National Vulnerability Database **NVD**
(severity score, affected configurations, links to technical info)
- Common Weakness Enumeration **CWE**
(lots of info)

Order of information:
CVE -> NVD -> CWE

### CVE
Assigned by CVE numbering authorities
Each entry has:
- CVE ID number
- brief descripition
- references

### NVD
U.S. government thing.
Analysis CVE's to get association impact metrics, vulnerability types, etc.

### CWE
Community-developed lists of weaknesses.
Baseline for weakness identification, mitigation and prevention

## Attack Techniques
- **CAPEC** : Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification
- **ATT&CK** : Adversial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge

### CAPEC

![[Pasted image 20210214142709.png]]
(try to match CWE “Related Attack Patterns” with CAPEC entries)
focus on weakness

### ATT&CK

The focus is on how they interact with systems during an operation.
- the "why" i.e., context
- "how" the tactical objective was achieved

## Guidelines
1. Start from available info (CVE, attack technique)
2. Use existing relationships (CWE to CAPEC)
3. Use keyword search
(There maybe more correct answers)
