# Addressing
Adressing modes - how the operand in an instruction is specfied
It tells you how to view or edit  the address field in an instruction

- Instruction = operator + a set of operands
- operands = either data or where data can be accessed
- Instruction format: a word has to take the same space as the data
- Have pointers in the operand place to get around the formatting problem

## How to tell which is used?
- varying opcodes
- flag bits: a mode field for each operand
