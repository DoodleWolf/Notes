# Smooth curve
## smooth curve in $\mathbb{E}^2$
A smooth curve $C$ in $\mathbb{E}^2$ is a set of points $( x(t), y(t) )$ where $t \in [0,1]$  and $x,y$ are smooth functions from $[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^2$

## length of $C$
$$\int \limits_0 ^1 \frac{ds}{dt} dt = \int \limits_0 ^1 \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2} dt$$

# 1.22 Exercise
The length of the Euclidean segment $a,b \in \mathbb{E}^2$ is equal to $||a-b||$

## proof
$$a,b \in \mathbb{E}^2 \Rightarrow a,b \in \mathbb{R}^2 \Rightarrow \text{line segment is }a-b \Rightarrow \text{distance} = ||a-b||$$

# 1.23 Exercise

^7d0cf0

$p_1,p_2 \in \mathbb{E}^2$ and $q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{E}^2$ are two distinct pairs of points. There exists an isometry sending $p_i$ to $q_i$ for $i=1,2$ iff $d(p_1,p_2)=d(q_1,q_2)$ 

## proof
- the proof starting from the isometry is trivial
- if the distance is the same then one can setup a translation and rotation to match this, which is an isometry


# 1.24 Theorem
The shortest curve between $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{E}^2$ is the line segment joining them.

## proof
1. assume $a$ is at $(0,0)$ and $b$ is at $(b,0)$ which can be done by [[#^7d0cf0 | 1.23]]
2. Then continue to shows that the absolute value integral is $||a-b||$ since distance is preserved ([[#^7d0cf0 | 1.23]])

# 1.25 Definition (geodesic)
Curve $C$ is a *geodesic* in $X$ if for any $a,b \in C$ the shortest path in $X$ from $a$ to $b$ is a segment of $C$ between $a$ and $b$
