# 3.17 Definition (Uniform Continuity)
$f$ is uniformly continuous on $I$ if for every $\epsilon$ there exists $\delta$ such that$\forall s,t \in I, \ |f(s)-f(t)|< \epsilon$  such that $|s-t| < \delta$

### intuition
uniform => normal continuity (but not the other way around necessarily)
- as the difference of $x$ and the difference $f(x)$ have to be consistent everywhere (or atleast not infinitely varying)

# 3.18 Theorem

^ab6451

$I$ is a closed bound interval
$f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $I$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $I$

### Proof

assume the opposite, then due to Bolzano-Weierstrass + bound interval a sub interval can be made which converges, then since f is continuous the they function of this subintervals limit must convergea and it therefore can be shown to be under $\epsilon$

#### intuition
bounded interval => bounded sequence => converging sequence + continuous => $|f(s_{n_{k}}) - f(t_{n_{k}})|< \epsilon$ => uniform

i think the intuition here is that the property must hold for converging sequences so it must be held overall.

- still wrapping my head around how uniform continuity translates to converging sequences
	- i suppose taking things as limits allows us to bound their differences and define their convergence
- this seems crucial for uniformity proving

# 3.19 Definition (linear)
$f$ is linear
$f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
$\exists c,d \in \mathbb{R}, \ \forall t \in I, \ f(t)=c+td$

$f$ is piecewise linear
$I=[a,b]$
$f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
$a=x_{0}<x_{1}< \dots < x_{n} = b$
where $f$ is linear for $(x_{k-1},x_{k})$

![[Pasted image 20210129173101.png]]
this makes sense as the limit from both sides would signify that the value be linear

# 3.20 Theorem
$f$ is continuous on $I=[a,b]$
$\forall t \in I, \ |f(t)-g(t)|<\epsilon$ will hold for some piece wise linear function $g$

 since $f$ is uniformly continuous fromm [[3.3 Uniform Continuity#^ab6451 | 3.18]] one can make a system for picking $x$'s that are $\delta$ apart for the an interval then apply this for those intervals of $f$ and because of [[3.2 Two Fundamental Theorems#^37faf7 | IVT]] one can obtain the needed values to satisfy the condition
 
 #### intuition
 a uniform continuous function can be sliced up into straight lines because it's differences in $x$ and it's differences in $f$ are consistent so to say
