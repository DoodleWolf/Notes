## 1.12.0 Notation (Higher order partial derivatives)
$$
\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2}=f_{xx} \quad \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}=f_{xy} \quad \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}=f_{yx} \quad \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y^2}=f_{yy}
$$


## 1.12.1 Theorem (Commutability of higher order partial derivatives)
$f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous to the $>k$-th derivative at $P \in \mathbb{R}^n$ => any two partial derivatives of the $k$ order involving the same variables are the same at $P$
