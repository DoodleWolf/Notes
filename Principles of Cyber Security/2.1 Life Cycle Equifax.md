- Looking at it like this gives one more steps at which the attack can be stopped


- reconnaissance : finding PII
- weaponization : unencrypted credentials
- delivery : login attempt for credentials
- exploitation : the login succeeding for credentials
- installation (what does it need to persist) : nothing
- comand & control : issue SQL to collect data
- actions on objective : sending the data out
