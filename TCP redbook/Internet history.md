## Timeline
1. 60s / 70s network designs is getting researched and many specific models are developed
2. [[Acronyms#DARPA |DARPA]] recognizes heterogenety problem. Creates ARPANET Network Group starts working on internetworking protocol.
3.  1974 ARPANET uses 56 Kbps interconnected [[Acronyms#PSN|PSN]]. Using a very simple protocol called 1822 since the systems were very reliable
4. 1978 protocol is in it's final state
5. 1980 [[Acronyms#DARPA|DARPA]] starts converting their computers to TCP/IP & NCP host-to-host protocol
6. 1983 [[Acronyms#DARPA|DARPA]] demands all computers connecting to ARPANET use TCP/IP
7. [[Acronyms#BBN |BBN]] implement TCP/IP protocols for Berkley UNIX
8. 1983 UNIX is distributed with TCP/IP and following versions
9. Data traffic quickly exceeds 56 Kbps, [[Acronyms#NSFNET|NSFNET]] takes over research networks, MILNET - military.
10. 56 Kbps -> 448 Kbps (1988) called T1 -> 45 Mbps (1992) called T2 -> 1995 handed over to commercial
11.  1992 [[Acronyms#AUP|AUP]] created and bans "use for-profit activities" but was used for commercial purposes (reverted back to normal in 1995)
12.  IBM, MCI  and Merit firn [[Acronyms#ANS|ANS]] to opeate T1 and was active in creating commericial presence on the internet
13. After reverting NSFNET back to academic role then the network was operated by multiple comercial backbones [[Acronyms#NAP|NAP]]s, [[Acronyms#MAE|MAE]]s and [[Acronyms#MFS|MFS]] also known as [[Acronyms#IXP|IXP]]s
14. Next Generation Initiative forms Internet2 project to "basically" improve the quality and ability of internet
