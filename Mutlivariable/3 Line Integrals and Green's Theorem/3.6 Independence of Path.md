## 3.6.1 Theorem (path independence)
$$
\text{the region is simply connected and $\frac{\partial P(x,y)}{\partial y} = \frac {\partial Q(x,y)}{\partial x}$ } \Rightarrow \text{the $\oint$ is path independent}
$$
where the line integral is 
$$
I= \int _\mathcal{C} \left(P(x,y)dx + Q(x,y)dy \right)
$$

- path independent: no matter what path you take the line integral will be the same between two points

## 3.6.2 Theorem (closed curve independence)
The line integral of any closed curve in a simply connected region is path independent iff if it's value is $0$
