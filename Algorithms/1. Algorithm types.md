## Focus 
- Designing an algorithm
- Proving the algorithm is right
- Analyzing length of algortih
- Fastest possible ways to solve problems

## Combinatorial optimization problems
Formally:
$$ \text{min } c(S): s \in X$$
- $c()$ is a cost function
- $X$ is the feasible solutions (finite)

Can always be solved by looking at each element for smallest cost
(complete enumeration)

## Three main types of problems

### Decision problems
#### Definition
Input:
- $X$ feasible set
- $c: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ cost function
- $L \in \mathbb{R}$
Output:
Whether $\exists s \in X, \ c(S) \leq L$ is true

#### Example
Given a model of the road network, is there a home-to-university path with a travel time shorter than 30 minutes?

### Search problems
#### Definition
Given:
- $X$ feasible set
- $c: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ cost function
- $L \in \mathbb{R}$
Output:
Returns $s$ such that $c(S) \leq L$ where $s \in X$

### Optimization problems
Given:
- $X$ feasible set
- $c: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

Output:
$\text{min } c(s) \text{ where } s \in X$

# Exact vs Inexact algorithms
## Exact algorithms
A global minimum for the cost function, i.e.,
$$\exists x^* \in X, \forall x \in X, \ c(x^*) \leq c(x)$$
$x^*$ is returned

## Apporximation algorithms
An return an approximate solution

### Example
$\alpha$-apporximate algorithm returns $x \in X$ s.t.
$$c(x^*)\leq c(x) \leq \alpha c(x^*) \text{ where } x^* \text{ is the optimal solution and } \alpha > 1$$

## Heuristic algorithms
Returns a solution with no relationship to $c(x^*)$

# Deterministic (and not) algorithms

## Deterministic
- They contain determined actions upon if-statements e.g. "“if A = B, do X; else, do Y"
- All solutions tend to share the same properties

## Randomized
- actions depend on random operations e.g. “toss a coin: if heads, do X; if tails, do Y”
- All solutions tend to have a cerrtain probability to hold certain properties

# Offline (and not) algorithms
## Offline
Instance $I$ is known at the start of the algorithm
### Example:
shortest path assuming no traffic (or that traffic is static)

## Online
Instance $I$ is gradually revealed (algorithm adapts to updates on $I$)
### Example
shortest path which accounts for a dynamically changing traffic

## Robust
Instance $I$ is not known (to an extent) and more does not get revealed, hence the algorithm must find a solution $\forall I$
### Example
shortest path given all possible traffic conditions
