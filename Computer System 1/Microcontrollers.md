# Microconctrollers
- self-contained coputer on a chip
![[Pasted image 20210130125343.png]]
- now can handle real floating point values
- run very simplified OS


## Memory
![[Pasted image 20210130125535.png]]
- similar amount of registers
- have to stream things in

## Embedded systems
- integrated into other systems (lots of different interfaces to talk to different devices)

## I/0
![[Pasted image 20210130125658.png]]
-serial devices (talk to GPS, USB devices)

## Low power
- very low power, approx 1mA in use, a 1 $\mu$A on standby

## Arduino platform
![[Pasted image 20210130125759.png]]
- proprietary
- has many users
- integrated enviorment 

## Microchip's PIC family
![[Pasted image 20210130130224.png]]
- PicAxe - for hobby electronics - you can type basic (of the bat?)

## TI MSP430
![[Pasted image 20210130130255.png]]
- von Neumann architecture (shared buss for radio and code)
- 16 bit
- CC430 includes onboard radio
	- the radio usually has it's on chip and can send and decode packets by itself taking a load of the main CPU

## ESP32 and Xtensa

## ARM
![[Pasted image 20210130130537.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210130130724.png]]
- 32bit architecture
- dominant in mobile phones
- 0.5mW/mHz

## Single chip computers
- A series ARM
- can run Linux/Android
- GHz clock Gbyte RAM (but RAM is external?)
