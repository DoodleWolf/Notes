# 3.21 Definition (pointwise limit)
$f_{n}: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
$f_{n}\rightarrow f$ point wise
if $\forall x \in X, \lim{f_{n}(x)}=f(x)$

# 3.22 Definition (uniform limit)
$f_{n}: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
$f_{n}\rightarrow f$ uniformly on $X$
if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ there $\exists n_{0}$ such that whenever $n\geq n_{0}$ $\forall x \in X, \ |f(x)-f_{n}(x)|< \epsilon$

"Comparing this to the definition of pointwise convergence, we see that the difference is that no can be chosen to work simultaneously for all x, rather than choosing no for each x separately."

# 3.23 Proposition
$(f_{n})$ is uniformly convergent iff it is uniformly Cauchy,

#### intuition
this one seems kinda obvious given that a seq. converges iff the cauchy converges

# 3.24 Theorem
if $f_{n}\rightarrow f$ uniformly on $I$ then $f$ is continuous on $I$

# 3.25 Theorem
$(f_{n})$ is monotone - either strictly increasing or decreasing per $n$ for every $x \in X$

if $(f_{n})$ converges pointwise to a continuous function the $f$, the $(f_{n})$ converges to $f$ uniformly

### proof
1. $g_{n}=|f-f_{n}|$, this is a decreasing sequence of continuous functions
2. $(g_{n})$ converges to 0 uniformly is the same as uniformm convergence on $I$ of $f$
	1. a subsequence $(x_{n_{k}})$ can be written which will converge to 0
	2. it has a neighborhood where $g_m(x)<\epsilon$
	3. further functions down the line are bounded by this one
	4. hence so are the upper bounds by $\epsilon$
	5. $(g_{n})$ converges to 0 uniformly

#### intuition
since there is an overall pattern and a pointwise convergence it makes sense that a uniform convergence could hold


# 3.26 Theorem Weierstrass M-test
if $\exists (M_{n}), \ |f_{n}(x)|\leq M_{n}|$ for $\forall x \in X$ ,and the sum of the bound converges than the series of $f_{n}$ converges uniformly
