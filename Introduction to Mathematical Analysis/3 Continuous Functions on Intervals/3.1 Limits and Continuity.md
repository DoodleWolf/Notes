# 3.1 Definiton (limit)
### Let
- $A \subset \mathbb{R}$
- $f:A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
### Right-hand limit
$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} f(x)=L$$
 $$\begin{align}& \exists c<b, (c,b) \subset A, \\ & \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \\ & \forall x \in A, \\ & |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \cap c < x < c + \delta \end{align}$$
 
 ### Left-hand limit
 $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}} f(x)=L$$
 The same except at the end there is $c - \delta < x < c$.
 
 ### Limit
 $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)=L$$
 if $\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} f(x)=\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}} f(x)=L$ then the limit equals L.
 
 # 3.2 Definition (limits)
 $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} f(x)= + \infty$$
 There exists and interval $(c, c+ \delta) \subset A$ such that $\forall x, \ M < f(x)$ for any $M \in \mathbb{R}$, i.e., unboundable for any interval
 -  $\lim_{ \ x\rightarrow \ + \infty} f(x) = L$ if for every interval from $(L-\epsilon,L+\epsilon)$ there exists an interval $(x_{0}, + \infty)$ such that if $x$ is in the "infinity" interval, then $f(x)$ is in the "$L$" interval

# 3.3 Definition (neighborhood)
$U$ is a neighborhood of a if $\exists \epsilon > 0, (a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon)\subset U$

$V$ is a neighborhood a relative to A if $\exists U \text{ neighborhood of a,} V= U \cap A$ where $a \in A$
- idea here is that $V$ might not be a full neighborhood but is "neighborhood enough" in terms of $A$

## limit 2.0
$I$ is a neighborhood of $c$
$f: I/{c} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
if $\forall$ neighborhoods of $L$, $\exists$ neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(U/{c}) \subset V$

# 3.4 Example
![[Pasted image 20210128221318.png]]
- the neighborhoods of all $t$ will never approach anything hence the limit won't exist for any $t$
 
# 3.5 Example
![[Pasted image 20210128225908.png]]
- since there is a finite amount (only one) of $t= \frac mn$ where m and n have no common factors
- but the $\mathbb{R}$ are dense in irrational numbers (transcendentals is what comes to mind)

# 3.6 Proposition

^fe24e0

- a function $f$ that is increasing over the interval $I=(a,b)$
- then the one-sided limites $f(t+)$ and $f(t-)$ exists
- and $f(t-)\leq f(x) \leq f(t+)$

#### proof
you look at the sup of $f((a,t))$ and the inf of $f((t,b))$, setup a left-side $\epsilon$ with the sup ![[Pasted image 20210128231439.png]]
setup the samme thing on the right-side $\epsilon$ with the inf

# 3.7 Definition (continuity)
Let:
- $I$ be an interval in $\mathbb{R}$
- $f:I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

$f$ is continuous at $c$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0, \ \exists \delta > 0$
  where $\forall x \in I$ with $|x-c|< \delta$ there is $|f(x)-f(c)| \leq \epsilon$
- $g: \epsilon \rightarrow \delta$, $g$ returning for any possible $\epsilon$ a $\delta$ that makes sure that all $x \in (c-\delta,c+\delta)$ that when inputted $f$ stay within $(f(c)-\epsilon,f(c)+\epsilon)$

# 3.8 Proposition

^a4434d

The following are equivalent:
![[Pasted image 20210128234017.png]]

#### intuition
they're all looking at the definition in a different light
(the book looks at e) but the connection to c and e is pretty visible as the definition of a lim it is both used here so the only equivalence one must draw is between the fact that approaching on an interval is the same as approaching on a sequence

# 3.10 Example
polynomials, rational, and $x^{+}, \ , x^{-} , |x|$ are all trivial (I assume this is understood as their sequences converge at each point)
![[Pasted image 20210128234909.png]]
- intuition being that nothing is in between the border between c and c+1

# 3.11 Propositon
the composition of two continuous functions is continuous.

#### intuition
[[#^a4434d | 3.8 d)]] allows us to inverse both function and see that we would have a neighborhood relative to a neighborhood relative to a neighborhood but this still works

# 3.13 Proposition
the set ($D$) of non-continuous points in $f$ (where $f$ increasing function on $I$) is countable

### proof
since the function is increasing according to [[#^fe24e0 | proposition 3.6]] $d$ must have a $f(d+)$ and a $f(d-)$, and since $mathbb{R}$ is dense in $\mathbb{Q}$ the limit interval $(f(d-),f(d+))$ must have a rational in it and $d,d' \in D$ where $d<d'$ must have different limit intervals $\rightarrow$ different rationals. Thus each $d$ can be mapped to a rational and the rationals are countable

#### intuition
i think the intuition here is that what makes something non-continuous is that it doesn't follow the "pattern" of the function and hence if there is a general "pattern" of a function the points of discontinuity must be discrete.

another way: the right and left limits are sup and inf of the intervals before and after the point. if there was a non-countable amount of discontinuities then the uncountable interval of discontinuity probably shares the same right and left sup's and inf's
