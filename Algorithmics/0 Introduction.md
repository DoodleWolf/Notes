# A brief history
- algorithm:  finite set of well-defined instructions for accomplishing some task
- derived from "algorism" : rules of preforming arithmetic computations Persian textbook
- 1930s precise mathematical understanding (Turing, lambda calculus, recursive functions)


# Algortihm
- input => output in a set of instructions to solve a computable problem


# Evaluating
- is it correct?
	- terminates
	- gives correct answer
- is it efficient?
	- running time
	- memory


# Examples
## Sorting
input: n values
output : ordered permutations

## Shortest Path
given road map shortest route from A to B

## Longest sub-sequence
the longest sub sequence of symbols in a sequence of symbols

## Scheduling
make a schedule with minimal waiting time taken into account to 

# Data structures
- are ways to store and organise data for ease of use
- choice affects efficiency
