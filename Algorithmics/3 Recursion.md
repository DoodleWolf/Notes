# Recursion

## infromal definition
strategy of reducing the problem to a smaller problem of the same type.

- the definitions are self-referential

## two parts
- base case: boundary case with trivial solution
- recursive clause: self-referential part driving the problem

## writing recursive programs
- figure the base case
- the recursive calls use a smaller problem

## cons
- all local variables in scope are put on a stack
-
