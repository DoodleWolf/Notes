# 3.1 Definition (GRP)
Given a graph $G=(V,A)$ (where $V$ is vertices and $A$ is arcs) and a node $s \in V$, find the set $M \subset V$ of all the nodes that are reachable from $s$.

## solution
1. Let $Q$ be a queue of nodes to explore
2. Initialize it with $Q= \{ s \}$
3. Each iteration on the elements of $Q$ do the following
	1. remove an item $i$ from $Q$
	2. add $i$ to $M$
	3. add all of the nodes reachable from $i$ to $Q$ that are not in $M$
	4. Halt when $Q=\emptyset$

# 3.3 Definition (Computational complexity)
The computational complexity of $A$ is $O(f_A)$

# 3.4 Definition (traceable)
A problem $P$ is **traceable** (or **well-solved**) if:
- there is an algorithm $A$ which solves it
- $A$ has a polynomial computational complexity
