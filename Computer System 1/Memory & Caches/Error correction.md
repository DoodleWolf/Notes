# Error correction
## Types of errors
- DRAM can lose data (how? not exactly sure)
	- accounting for these errors is important on servers and high-ram workstations
- Hard failure from a permanent defect (most common)
- Soft Error (random, non-destructive)

## Can be detected with a parity bit
A bit is used to make all bit sum even (or odd) and can therefore can be checked whether any bit has flipped.
