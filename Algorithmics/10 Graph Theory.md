## 10.1 Definition (Trial)
edges are unique

## 10.2 Definition (Path)
edges are unique and vertices are unique

## 10.3 Defintion (Circuit)
A closed trial

## 10.4 Definition (Cycle)
A closed circuit

## 10.5 Definition (Connected Graph)
A graph where theres is a route from each vertex to any other vertex

## 10.6 Definition (Tree)
a connected graph with no cycles

## 10.7 Definition (Forest)
A collection of trees, i.e., a every connected ccomponent is a tree but they are not necessarily all connected to each other

## 10.8 Definition (Bipartite Graph)
The vertices can be partitioned into two classes such that every edge has its ends in a different class

## 10.9 Definition (Complete Graph)
A simple graph in which every pair of verticies is connected by an edge, $K_n$ 

## 10.10 Definition (k-regular)
every vertex is of degree $k$

## 10.11 Definition (planar graph)
a graph can be drawn with no edges crossing

Check everything at that depth before moving on

## 10.16 Algorithm (Depth First Search)
go as far as possible then start again

##  10.17 Definition (Walk enumeration)
how many walks (of length-k ?)
