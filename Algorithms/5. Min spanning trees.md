## 5.1 Defintion (subgraph)
$G_S = (V_S, E_S)$ is a subgraph of undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ if:
1. $G_S$ is a graph
2. $V_S \subset V$
3. $E_S \subset E$
$(1.) \Rightarrow  \forall e={i,j} \in E_S, \ i,j \in V_S$


## 5.2 Definition (tree)
$G_T=(V_T, E_T)$ (a subgraph of $G$) a tree if:
1. $G_T$ is connected
2. $G_T$ contains no cycles (acyclic)

## 5.3 Defintion (spanning)
Tree $G_T=(V_T, E_T)$ is spanning $G=(V,E)$ if $V_T=V$

## 5.4 Definition (minimal cost spanning tree problem)
Given:
- an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
- a cost function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (let $c(E)\equiv\sum \limits_{e \in E} c_e$)

Find: 
spanning tree $G_T=(V,E_T)$ s.t. $c(E_T) = \min \{ c(E_S) : G_S=(V_S,E_S) \text{ is spanning } G\}$

## 5.5 Definition (leaf)
A node of degree 1 of a graph

## 5.6 Proposition

A tree $G_T$ contains at least a leaf.

#### proof
assume $G_T$ contains no leaves => all nodes have degree $\geq 2$ => $G_T$ contains a cycle

## 5.7 Proposition
A tree $G_T$ with $n$ nodes contains $n-1$ edges

#### proof
Proof by induction:
1. $n=1$ => $G_T$ has $1$ node hence $0$ edges
2. Assume $n=k$ case
3. $n=k+1$, remove leaf node and you get one less edge

## 5.8 Theorem (Jarnik's Theorem)
$F$: a subgraph of the edge-set of the optimal solution of the MST
$V$: set of nodes spanned by $F$
$S \subset V$, consider $\delta (S)$
$$ 
\forall e \in \delta (S), \ F \cup \{ e \} \text{ is a part of an MST} \Leftrightarrow e= \min \{c(e) : e \in \delta (S) \}
$$

#### proof
1. "$\Rightarrow$": $\ F \cup \{ e \} \text{ is a part of an MST} \Rightarrow e= \min \{c(e) : e \in \delta (S) \}$
Assume contrapositive:
$$
\begin{align}
\ F \cup \{ e \} \text{ is a part of an MST} &\Rightarrow e \neq \min \{c(e) : e \in \delta (S) \} \\
&\Rightarrow \exists f \in \delta (S) : c_f < c_e \\
&\Rightarrow G_T' \equiv (V, (E_T \cup \{ f \}) \backslash \{ e \}) \text{ is a spanning tree} \\
c(G_T')<c(G_T) &\Rightarrow G_T \text{ is not the MST}
\end{align}
$$

2. "$\Leftarrow$": $\ F \cup \{ e \} \text{ is a part of an MST} \Leftarrow e= \min \{c(e) : e \in \delta (S) \}$
- case 1: $e \in E_T$
claims is proven

- case 2: $e \notin E_T$
$P$ is the path between $i,j$ where $e= \{ i,j\}$
$P$ goes from $S$ to $V \backlash S$ => contain an edge in $f \in \delta (S)$. Let $G_T' \equiv (V, (E_T \cup \{ e \}) \backslash \{f \})$ is a spanning tree. $e$ is a min => $c_e \leq c_f$ => $c(G_T') \leq c(G_T)$, since $c(G_T)$ is a min => $c(G_T')$ is a min. cost

## 5.9 Algorithm (Jarnik-Prim-Dijkstra)
![[Pasted image 20210220145851.png]]

Takes $O(nm)=O(n^3)$ time

#### better implementation
![[Pasted image 20210220153546.png]]
Takes $O(n^2)$ time

**idea**: keep updating what the shortest path to each node is, every loop pick the node with the smallest shortest path
