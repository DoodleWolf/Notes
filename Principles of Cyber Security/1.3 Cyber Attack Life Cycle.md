# Cyber-attack life cycle model
The stages the attack goes through.

## Why
- Figure out why they succeed
- develop structured knowledge
- identify convenient and effective counter-measures
- forecast potential next steps during ongoing attack

## Lockheed Martin's Kill Chain Model
### Reconnaissance
Target research and selection

Example: gathering email addresses

### Weaponization
Development of required cyber weapons

Example: PDF with embedded malicious script, setup C&C, phishing email, Remate Access Trojan

### Delivery
Delivery of weapons to the target

Example: email attachment, usb stick

### Exploitation
Excuting the weapon through the exploit

Example: exploit known bugs, OS auto-start

### Installation
Ensure the payload stays within the target

Example: inject the malicious payload inside an OS process

### Command & Control
Establish communication to an external command and control (C2) server

Example: ciphered connections over HTTPS

### Actions on Objectives

When the desired actions are taken within the target

Example: Data exfiltration, disruption
