# 2.6 Theorem
Every isometry of $\mathbb{S}^2$ is induced by an orthogonal matrix $A \in O(3)$
1. $\operatorname{det}A=1 \Rightarrow$ rotation around a line $L$ through $0$
2. $\operatorname{det}A=-1 \Rightarrow$ rotation around  a line $L$ through $0$ with a reflection in the plane orthogonal to $L$

# 2.7 Definition (special orthogonal group)
$\operatorname{SO}(3)$ is the group of matrices of determinant 1
