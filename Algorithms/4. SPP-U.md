# 4.1 Definition (SPP-U)
Shortest Path Problem with a Unrestricted lengths:
Given a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ with a length function $l: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, find the shortest length path between two nodes $s,t \in V$

## 4.1.1 Example

# 4.2 Definition (simple path)
If the path does not visit the same node twice

# 4.3 Proposition
If a directed graph $G$ contains an $s$-$t$ path $P$ which contains a negative cycle then SPP-U is unbounded.

## proof
Going another cycle will result in a shorter path hence it is unbounded.

# 4.4 Proposition
If no s-t path in $G$ contains a negative-length cycle, then $G$ contains a shortest s-t path which does not contain any cycles.

## proof
the only cycles are of length $\geq 0$ which means they can be taken out and either cause a reduce or no change.

# 4.5 Definition (SSPP-U)
Find the shortest path of a node $s$ and each node $i \in V/{s}$ in $G$.

# 4.6 Theorem (subpath optimality)
If $P$ is the shortest path between $i_1-i_k$ then an for $1<u<v<k$ $i_u,i_v \in P$ the subpath $i_u-i_k$ is  the shortest path.

# 4.7 Definition (value function)
$$ f_k(i) $$
the length of a shortest $s-i$ path containing no more than $k$ arcs

# 4.8 Lemma
If $k=n-1$ for $f_k(i)$ the restriction to no more than $k$ arcs vanishes.

## proof
(assume there can be no negative cycles)
- a simple path contains at most $n$ nodes hence at most $n-1$ arcs
- $f_{n-1}(i)$ is the length of a shortest $s-i$ path

# 4.9 Theorem (Bellman-Ford theorem)
$$ f_k (i)= \operatorname{min} \{ f_{k-1}(i), \operatorname{min} \limits_{(j,i) \in \delta ^- (i)} \{ f_{k-1}(j) + l_{ji} \} \}$$

## proof
1. either contains one more arc than a shortest $s-i$ path with at most $k-1$ arcs
2. or it does not

# 4.10 Definition (precedessor)
$P_k (i)$ is the last node in the shortest $s-i$ path with at most $k$ arcs.

## Detecting a negative-length cycle
If running the algorithm one more time ($k$ times) results in a change than $k-1$
