since we know $a_{n} \rightarrow 0$ we setup a collection of $a_{\phi (n)}$ such that we constantly keep over shooting the bounds but progressively over shoot them by smaller amounts. This is done by constantly redefining $\phi (n)$ every time a bound is over shot, therefore mapping all $\mathbb{N}$ in such a way that the series $a_{ \phi (n)}$ bounds approach $\alpha$ and $\beta$
