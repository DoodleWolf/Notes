# 1.01 Cartesian Product
## Definition
$$G \times H  \equiv \{ (g,h) | g \in G, h \in H \}$$

# Definition 1.1
## Binary operation
### Definition
binary operation on set $G$: A function $f$ such that $f: G \times G \rightarrow G$

### Examples
$$a+b$$
$$ a*b$$

## Group
### Definition
A set $G$ with a a binary operation $*$ (known as the "group operation" or "group multiplication")
where it follows that:
- Associativity: $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$
- Identity existence: $\exists e \in  G,  \forall a \in G, \ e*a=a=a*e$
- Inverse existence: $\forall a \in G, \exists b \in G, \ a*b=e$ where $e$ is the identity

### Abelian
it follows commutativity $a*b=b*a$

#### Size
Called *cardinality*, $|G|$, also called order

# Example 1.2
- addition is defined as a binary operation for $\mathbb{N}$ but subtraction is not, $2-3=-1 \notin \mathbb{N}$
- $\mathbb{Z,Q,R,C}$ with addition are abelian groups
	- $\mathbb{Q}^{*}\equiv \mathbb{Q} \backslash \{ 0 \}$ and the rest are abelian groups with multiplication
- addition is not a group in $\mathbb{N}$ since there are no inverses
- $M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R})$ (set of real m-by-n matrices) is a group under addition
- $GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ (set of invertible n-by-n matrices, called the *general linear group*) is a group under matrix multiplicatoin 

# Proposition 1.3
- Given $G$ is a group, there exists precisely one identity element in $G$
- Given $G$ is a group, there is one inverse to $a \in G$ (written $a^{-1}$ or if our group operations is "+" then $-a$)

## proof
rather trivial just assume there is another

# Proposition 1.4

^c3807c

Let $G$ be a group with operation $*$:
- Cancellation: $\forall a,b,c \in G, \ (a*z=b*z \Leftrightarrow a=b)$
	-  multiply both with an inverse 
- $\forall a \in G$ $a*x=b$ and $y*a=b$ have a unique solution in $G$ ($x \leftrightarrow a*x$ and $y \leftrightarrow y *a$, left and right translation by $a$ are bijective)
	- ![[Pasted image 20210203171303.png]] (im not really sure what right translation has to do with surjectivity)
- $\forall a \in G, \ (a^{-1})^{-1}=a$
- $\forall a,b \in G \ (a*b)^{-1}=b^{-1}*a^{-1}$

# Example 1.5
## 1.5.a
### Group table
#### Definition
$G= \{ a_{1}, a_{2},\dots,a_{n} \}$ is a group under "$*$"

### Trivial group

### Sudoku rules
from [[1. Groups#^c3807c | prop 1.4.2]] we can see that each row and column must be unique, i.e., following sudoku rules
but that's not all..
![[Pasted image 20210203172604.png]]
this example follows "sudoku rules" but does not work
$$a*a*b=(a*a)*b=a*(a*b)$$
$$e*b=a*c$$
$$b\neq d$$

## 1.5.b
### Cyclic group of order $m$
$C_{m} \equiv \{ \bar{0}, \bar{1}, \dots, \bar{m-1} \}$ where $m \in \mathbb{N}$
![[Pasted image 20210203173140.png]]
$C_{m}$ is an abelian group under $\oplus$

### proof

## 1.5.c
### Permutation of $S$
$\operatorname{Sym}(S)$ denote the set of all bijective maps $\pi : S \leftrightarrow S$. $\operatorname{Sym}(S)$ is called the permutations of $S$

#### abelian group
$\pi , \sigma \in \operatorname{Sym}(S)$ where $\sigma \circ \pi$ is the composition of $\sigma , \pi$

$\operatorname{Sym}(S)$ is a group under $\circ$
- the identity function : $\mathbf{id}$
- inverse: $\pi^{-1}$

## Definition 1.6
### Cycle (permutations)
Let $1 \geq n \geq s$
Let $a_{1}, \dots  , a_{s} \in \{1, \dots , n \}$ where each $a$ is pairwise distinct
![[Pasted image 20210203180242.png]]
denoted by $\langle a_{1}, \dots , a_{s} \rangle$
All permutations of this form are called **cycles**

### Transportation
A **cycle** where $s=2$. $s$ is also the length (or order)

## Proposition 1.7
Every permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ is a composition of cycles.

### Proof(ish)
The notes provide an algorithm for finding a permutations $\sigma$ cycle composition:
1. repeatedly apply this to one element until it returns to to itself, ie, $\sigma^{m}(a)=a$, then the set of those elements will be a cycle composition (this must be the case since all permutations are bijective)
2. repeat this process for another element not found in the previous cycle compositions
3. continue 1-2 to get all the elements


## Example 1.8

## Definition 1.9
### sign (signum)
$$\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \equiv (-1)^{(s_{1}-1)+(s_{2}-1)+\dots}$$
where the permutation $\sigma = \sigma_{1} \circ \sigma_{2} \circ \dots$ where $\sigma_{n}$ is a cycle of length $s_{n}$

Note: $\operatorname{sgn}(\mathbf{id})=1$

## Theorem 1.10
1. $sgn(\sigma)$ does not depend on the chosen cycle decomposition of $\sigma$
2. $\forall \sigma , \tau \in S_{n} , \ \operatorname{sgn} ( \sigma \circ \tau ) = \operatorname{sgn} ( \sigma ) \cdot \operatorname{sgn}( \tau )$
