# 3.14 Theorem
A continuous real-valued functions on a closed bounded interval attains maximum and minimum values

#### intuition
the sup of ${f(x): x \in J}$ must be a real number as $\infty$ would imply a discontinuity, hence there are maximum and minimumm values
(can be seen by the setting up a sequence that through it's limit diverges which cannot be the case since the function must be continuous)


# 3.15 Theorem (Intermediate Value Theorem)

^37faf7

if $f(a)<y<f(b)$ there exists $a<x<b$ with $f(x)=y$

### Proof
- you break up into segments ${t_{-}\in [a,b]: f(t_{-})<y}$ and ${t_{+}\in [a,b]: y<f(t_{+})}$ then show that the sequences from each side approaching $y$ will be $y$ and hence in $(a,b)$

#### intuition
all neighborhoods within $(f(a),f(b))$ have to be reachable through neighborhoods of $(a,b)$

# 3.16 Theorem

^3d4d58

$f: I \rightarrowtail \mathbb{R}$ is continuous then $g=f^{-1}$ is continuous on $f(I)$

### Proof
- injection implies strictly increasing or decreasing (otherwise $f(a)=f(b)$ could be $a \neq b$)
$a<t<b \Rightarrow 
^{\text{strictly increasing}} f(a)<t<f(b)$
$\Rightarrow g^{-1} \supset (f(a),f(b)) \Rightarrow$ meet [[3.1 Limits and Continuity#^a4434d | 3.8 d) proposition]]  for continuity

#### intuition
injection is necessary to make sure $g$ is a function, but it would continuous regardless
