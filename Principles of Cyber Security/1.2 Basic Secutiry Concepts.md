# Cyber Secuirty CIA Triad
## The Triad
Three security objectives for information sys. :
- Confidentiality (preserving authorization to restricted information)
- Integrity (protecting against improper modification, ie, authenticity)
- Availability (timely and reliable access , ie, no disruption)

## Integrity
Authenticity (genuine and verifiable):
	- can confirm sender, message and transmission

Accountability (actions are traceable):
- because truly secure systems do not yet exist
- supports: intrusion detection, after-action recovery, fault isolation and legal action


# A model of Computer Security

## Definition (asset)
Asset is a system resource: hardware, software, data, networks

## Asset vulnerabilities
Ways to target an asset
Types:
- corruption: it gives wrong answers
- leaky: someone has information that they shouldn't have
- unavailable: the system can become very slow/impractical

The **threat** is the fact that the vulnerability can be exploited.

## Attack classification
- Active attack: alter assets/affect their operation (changes system)
- Passive attack: learn or make use of information (does not change system)
- Inside attack: initiated by an enity inside the security parameter
- Outside attack: initiated by an unauthorized user of the system

**risk**: a measure of the extent to which an asset is threatened by potential events 

**countermeasure**: any means taken to deal with a security threat

# Basic Security Controls
**Encryption**: the transformation of info using a secret (key)

**Access control**: rules and mechanisms that limit access
**Authorization**: determining when access is allowed
**Authentication**: determing the identity of the user

**Physical security**: physical barrier between hardware

**backups**: copies of data to restore
**checksums**: to check if the contents of the file are change via numerical value
**computational redundancies**: fallbacks if something fails
