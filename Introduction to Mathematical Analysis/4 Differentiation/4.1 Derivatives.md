# 4.1 Definition (Derivative)
![[Pasted image 20210131192203.png]]
goes on to say that differentiability is a local property

# 4.2 Proposition
$f$ is differentiable at $x$ iff $\exists \phi : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $\phi$ continuous at $x$, such that $\forall y \in I, \ f(y)=f(x)+(y-x)\phi(y)$.
in this case, $f'(x)=\phi(x)$

## intuition
just rephrasing the definition

# 4.3 Corollary
if $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then $f$ is continuous at $x$

## intuition
limit has to exist

# 4.4 Example

$$f'(x)=\lim \limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} $$

# 4.5 Proposition
$f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is differentaible at $x\in I$ 
<=> 
$\exists L : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t. } f(x+h)=f(x)+L(h)+r(h), \text{ where } r \text{ defined on the neighborhood of } 0 \text{ and } \lim \limits_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{r(h)}{h}=0$

Note: $L$ is the differential of $f$ at $x$
