# Routing

Occurs when there's a change in IP address spaces.

Router - routes between different networks and subnets (not looking at all it's broader features)

## Multiple Paths

#### Internet managed: BGP

#### Local: RIP or OSPF

Looks for the shortest path (in terms of it's view, ie, for the health of the network or for local preformances)
