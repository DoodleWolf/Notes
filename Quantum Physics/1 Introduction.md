# 1.1 Classical mechanics
Equation of motion:
$$ m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=- \frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$

# 1.2 Quantum mechanics
Equation of motion in quantum world:
$$ i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}= - \frac{ \hbar^2}{\partial t} \frac{\partial ^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V \psi$$

$\Psi = \Psi (x,t)$ is a complex-valued function defined in all space at a given time t.

The wave function $\Psi$ determines the probability of finding the particle at some point $x$ in time $t$:

$$\int \limits _a ^b | \Psi (x,t)|^2 dx = \text { probability of finding the particle between a and b at time t}$$

 Note: $|\Psi |^2 = \Psi ^* \Psi$

 The physical wave functions correspond only to square-integrable solution of the Schrodinger Equation.

 $\Psi (x,t) \rightarrow 0$ since it's require to be normalizable and so does $\frac{\partial \Psi} {\partial x}$
