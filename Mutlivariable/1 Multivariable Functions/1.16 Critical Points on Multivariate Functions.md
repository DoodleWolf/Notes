## 1.16.1 Theorem
$f: D \subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has max/min value iff:
1. it's a critical point: $\nabla f(a)=0$
2. it's a singular point: $\nabla f(a) = \text{D.N.E.}$
3. it's a boundary point of $D$

#### proof
otherwise it will be increasing/decreasing in $u= \pm \frac{\nabla}{|\nabla f|}$ direction

## 1.16.2 Proposition
Given a $(a,b)$ such that $\nabla f(a,b)=0$ it's a
1. maximum if $f_{xx}(a,b)<0$ and $f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}^2(a,b)>0$
2. minimum if $f_{xx}(a,b)>0$ and $f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}^2(a,b)>0$ 
3. a saddle point if the  $f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}^2(a,b)<0$ 

#### proof
The idea is that looking at the taylor series of the function at $(a,b)$ deletes the first terms, and when one looks at a small enough neighborhood the second terms following are what matter hence one must look at if the quadratic formed by the second terms is positive or negative.
In the saddle case, it's positive in some areas and negative in others hence it's neither max or min

## 1.16.3 Definition (Hessian matrix)
$$
H(f)(x,y)= \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2} & \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \\
\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} & \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y^2} 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## 1.16.4 Definition (Hessian determinant)
$$
\Delta (x,y)= \begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2} & \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \\
\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} & \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y^2} 
\end{vmatrix}
$$

## 1.16.5 Definition (determinant sequence)
$$
\Delta _0 = 1 \quad 
\Delta _1 = a_{11} \quad 
\Delta _2 = \begin{vmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} 
\end{vmatrix} \quad \dots \quad
\Delta _k = \begin{vmatrix}
a_{11} & \dots & a_{1k} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{k1} & \dots & a_{kk} 
\end{vmatrix}
$$
