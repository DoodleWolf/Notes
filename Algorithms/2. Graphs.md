# 2.1 Definition (directed graph)
A *directed graph* is an ordered pair $G \equiv (V,A)$ where:
- $V$ is the set of *vertices* ($n \equiv |V|$)
- $A$ is a set called *arcs*, $A \subset V \times V$ ($m \equiv |A|$)

Given an arc $(i,j) \in A$, $i$ and $j$ are the tail and head

# 2.2 Definition (adjacent)
A node $j \in V$ is adjacent to another node $i \in V$ if $(i,j) \in A$

# 2.3 Definition (incident)
$a \in A$ is incident to a node $j\in V$ if $a=(i,j)$ for some $i \in V$ (if $j$ is the head of the arc)

# 2.4 Example

# 2.5 Definition (complete directed graph)
A directed graph $G$ is complete if:
$$ A = \{ (i,j): i \in V, j \in V} $$

# 2.6 Proposition
In any directed graph $|A| \leq |V|(|V|-1)$

## proof
The complete directed graph has $n$ nodes connected to $n-1$ nodes hence $|A|$ for a complete directed graph would be $n(n-1)$ so all directed graphs are $|A| \leq n(n-1)$.

# 2.7 Definition (sparse)
A graph is sparse if $|A| << n(n-1)$

# 2.8 Definition (path)
A path is a sequence of connected arcs with distinct arcs:
$$ (i_1,i_2), (i_2,i_3), \dots$$

# 2.9 Definition (connected)
node $v \in V$ is connected to node $w\in V$ if there is a path starting with a tail $v$ and ending with a head $w$

# 2.10 Definition (connected for graphs)
A graph is connected if all pairs of vertices are connected.

# 2.11 Definition (cycle)
A cycle is a sequence of arcs where the intial tail and the final head are the same (cycles may contain a node multiple times)

# 2.12 Definition (forward directed cuts)
forward directed cut induced by $S$ on $V$
$$ \delta^+ (S) \equiv \{ (i,j) \in A | i \in S \cap j \in V/S \} \text{ where } S \subset V$$
(the set of arcs “leaving S”, with tail in S and head in V/S)
## Example

# 2.13 Definition (backward directed cuts)
backward directed cut induced by $S$ on $V$
$$ \delta^- (S) \equiv \delta^+ (V/S) = \{(i,j) \in A | i \in V/S \cap j \in S \} \text{ where } S \subset V$$
(the set of arcs “entering S”, with tail in V/S and head in S)

# 2.14 Definition (forward/backward stars)
Forward stars: $\delta^+ (\{i \} )$
out-degree: $| \delta^+ (\{i \} )|$
![[Pasted image 20210208212704.png]]

Backward stars: $\delta^- (\{ i \} )$
in-degree: $| \delta^- (\{ i \} ) |$

# 2.15 Definition (undirected graphs)
A undirected graph $E$ is a set of non-ordered pairs $V \times V$
- edge $e= \{ i,j\} \in E$ is incident to both $i$ and $j$
- $i$ and $j$ are mutually adjacent if $e=\{i,j\} \in E$
- $i$ and $j$ are mutually connected
- A undirected graph is complete if $E=  \{ \{i,j\} | i \in V \cap j \in V \cap i \neq j \}$

# 2.16 Proposition
In any undirected graph, we have $m \leq \frac 12 n(n-1)$

# 2.17 Definition (sparse for undirected graphs)
$$m  \ll \frac 12 n(n-1)$$

# 2.18 Definition (star)
$$\delta ( \{ i \} ) \text{ where } i \in V$$

# 2.19 Definition (degree)
$$| \delta (\{ i \} ) |$$

# 2.20 Definition (adjacency list)

$$L : \mathbb{N} \leq n \rightarrow S \subset V$$
where $L(i)$ returns the the indices of the nodes to which $i$ is adjacent

## example

# 2.21 Definition (adjacency matrix)
An adjacency matrix is a binary matrix $D \in \{ 0, 1 \}^{n \times n}$ where $(i,j) \in A$ or $E \Rightarrow d_{ij}=1$ otherwise $d_{ij}=0$

Note: $D$ is always symmetric for undirected graphs
