# Monitoring

Everything generates a log somewhere:
- network owners need to check what's happening
- government is always pushing more legislation to track

## Staying anonymous?

### VPNs
- Still create a log somewhere
- VPN exit point can be monitored


### ToR
- Routes traffic through a series of random hops
- Traffic is encrypted all the way
- Not foolproof, contains other exploitable vulnerabilites
